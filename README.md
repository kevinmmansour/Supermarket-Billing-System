### Supermarket Billing System In C++

Supermarket billing system is based on the concept to generate the bill reports and to add items and update their details. 

The whole concept is designed via c++ language.

This supermarket billing system is a simple console application built in C++ without the use of graphics. 

This project will help you understand basically two things – use of stream class and file handling in c++ programming language.

### About the system

Two classes, class amount, and the class item can be found in this project in which class amount is inherited from the class item. The project is simple to understand, and the source code has been presented in an understandable manner.

Supermarket billing system is a very simple mini project in C++, built as a console application without using graphics features. It’s just a demonstration of the use of file handling and stream class in C++ language.

### Listed below are the key features of this project:

Bill Report: It shows the bill report of all the items added in supermarket billing system.
Add, Remove or Edit items: With this feature, you can add, remove and modify item details. 

In, add items, you can add information or details.

Show item details: This feature allows users to see the items and the corresponding details given for the item while adding the item.

Some rooms for improvements in this supermarket billing system project include the use of ‘while’ loop instead of the ‘goto’ label.

Many programmers consider the use of ‘goto’ label to be not good or less efficient.

You can take the use of ‘goto’ label as the prime defect of this project. 

It has been used to jump from one menu to another within the program. 

Also, for editing and deleting the recorded items, separate functions have not been used.
